# Mascord: The Agentic Discord Assistant

**Mascord** is a high-performance, modular Discord bot written in Rust. It combines any **OpenAI-compatible LLM** (like `llama.cpp`, LocalAI, vLLM, or OpenAI itself), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a native music player with an advanced **Agentic** core powered by built-in native tools.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧠 **Three-Tier Persistent Memory**: Advanced context management featuring:
  - **Short-Term**: Verbatim recent conversation history (last 50 messages).
  - **Working Memory**: Condensing older interactions into persistent summaries via autonomous background jobs or manual triggers.
  - **Long-Term**: On-demand retrieval and LLM-powered summarization of historical messages (RAG).
- 🎵 **Interactive Music Player**: High-quality streaming with a rich UI:
  - **Interactive Queue**: Paginated queue display with control buttons (Pause, Skip, Stop).
  - **Deep Integration**: Uses `yt-dlp` and `songbird` with cookie support for detection bypass and age-restricted content.
- 🤖 **Agentic Core**: An autonomous agent trained to use internal and external tools (including native web search and URL fetch) to solve complex, multi-step requests.
- ⚙️ **Configurable Settings**: Per-guild configuration for context limits, retention policies, and manual working-memory refreshes.
- ⏰ **Reminder Scheduler**: Durable natural-language reminders (`in 2 days`, `3 hours`, `at 22:15`) with list/cancel support and background delivery.

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### 1. Prerequisites

Mascord requires the following external tools for full functionality:
- **Rust Toolchain**: Required to build and run
- **yt-dlp**: Required for YouTube metadata and audio
- **FFmpeg**: Required for audio processing
- **CMake**: Required for building native libraries
- **LLM Provider**: Any OpenAI-compatible API (e.g., `llama.cpp` server, LocalAI, vLLM, or OpenAI)

#### macOS Installation (Recommended)

On macOS, use **Homebrew** to install all dependencies automatically:

```bash
# Install all dependencies at once
brew install rustup ffmpeg yt-dlp node cmake opus pkg-config

# Initialize Rust
rustup default stable
```

Verify installation:
```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version

node --version
```

Or use the provided `Brewfile` for reproducible installs:
```bash
brew bundle  # Installs all dependencies from Brewfile
```

#### Linux Installation

Use your system's package manager:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install rustup ffmpeg yt-dlp nodejs cmake libopus-dev pkg-config

# macOS (alternative if Homebrew not available)
sudo port install rust ffmpeg yt-dlp nodejs cmake libopus
```

#### Platform Notes

- **macOS**: Fully supported on Apple Silicon (ARM64) and Intel. All dependencies available via Homebrew.
- **Linux**: Supported on most distributions. See SETUP_MACOS.md for macOS-specific notes.

### 2. Configuration (`.env`)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your credentials:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Fill in the following essential variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | Your bot's token from the Discord Developer Portal. |
| `APPLICATION_ID` | Your bot's application ID. |
| `LLAMA_URL` | The OpenAI-compatible endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/v1`). **Must include `/v1`** for most local providers and **no trailing slash**. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Path to the SQLite database (e.g., `data/mascord.db`). |

> [!TIP]
> Many more settings (timeouts, retention policies, YouTube settings, etc.) are available! Check the [`.env.example`](.env.example) file for the full list of configurable options.

#### Discord Message Content Intent

Enable **Message Content Intent** in the Discord Developer Portal:
**Application → Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents**.  
This is required for mention/reply handling and message memory, and is mandatory once the bot is in 100+ servers.

```

### 3. Database Setup

**Do I need to setup a database first?**
**No.** Mascord uses SQLite and handles its own database initialization. On the first run, the bot will automatically:
1. Create the `data` directory (if it doesn't exist).
2. Create the SQLite database file at the path specified in `DATABASE_URL`.
3. Initialize all necessary tables and indexes.

The `data/` directory is gitignored and will never be committed.

### 4. Build the Project

Build the bot once to create the optimized binary:

```bash
cd /path/to/mascord
cargo build --release    # Optimized binary (recommended)
cargo build              # Debug binary (faster compilation)
```

The release binary is located at: `target/release/mascord`

### 5. Running the Bot

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Avoid Rate Limits!**

Before starting your bot, ensure command registration is configured correctly to avoid Cloudflare IP bans:

```bash
# In .env - Set to false by default!
REGISTER_COMMANDS=false
DEV_GUILD_ID=your_test_server_id
```

**Why?** Setting `REGISTER_COMMANDS=true` causes the bot to register commands on **every startup**. Frequent restarts can trigger Discord's Cloudflare protection (**1+ hour IP ban**).

**When to enable command registration:**
- ✅ First time running the bot
- ✅ When you've modified command signatures (added/removed commands or parameters)
- ❌ Normal development restarts

**Best practice workflow:**
1. Set `REGISTER_COMMANDS=true` and `DEV_GUILD_ID` to your test server
2. Start bot once to register commands
3. Set `REGISTER_COMMANDS=false`
4. Continue development normally

#### Quick Start (Recommended)

**Use the provided `bot.sh` script** for an easy setup-and-run experience:

```bash
# Run the bot (release mode - optimized and recommended)
./bot.sh

# Or debug mode (verbose logging)
./bot.sh debug
```

The script automatically:
- Creates the `data/` directory
- Verifies your `.env` configuration
- Builds the binary if needed
- Starts the bot

#### Manual Startup

If you prefer to run without the script:

```bash
# Ensure data directory exists
mkdir -p data/

# Run with cargo
cargo run --release     # Optimized (recommended)
cargo run               # Debug mode

# Or run the compiled binary directly
./target/release/mascord
```

📖 **For detailed information**, see [SETUP_COMPLETE.md](SETUP_COMPLETE.md) and [DATABASE_FIX.md](DATABASE_FIX.md)

### 6. Native Web Tools

Mascord now ships with native tools for live web research:

- `web_search`: Queries your configured SearXNG instance (`SEARXNG_URL`)
- `fetch_url`: Fetches and extracts readable text from HTTP/HTTPS pages (readability-optimized)
- `fetch_url` with `render_javascript=true`: Uses Jina AI Reader for JS-heavy pages (no API key)
- `fetch_url` with `render_mode=auto`: Uses local fetch first, then auto-falls back to Jina Reader when content quality is poor

No MCP server setup is required.

## � Monitoring Your Bot

### Check if Bot is Running

```bash
# See running Mascord process
ps aux | grep mascord

# Check database message count
sqlite3 data/mascord.db "SELECT COUNT(*) as messages FROM messages;"

# View real-time logs (if running in background)
tail -f /tmp/mascord.log
```

### Stop the Bot

```bash
# Graceful shutdown (saves state)
pkill -f "target/release/mascord"

# Or in Discord, use (owner-only):
/admin shutdown
```

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Bot won't start | `mkdir -p data/` and verify `.env` has `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `APPLICATION_ID` |
| "Failed to open database" | `mkdir -p data/` - SQLite needs parent directory to exist |
| Database errors | `rm data/mascord.db` (will be recreated on startup) |
| LLM connection fails | Check `LLAMA_URL` is accessible: `curl $LLAMA_URL/models` |
| Bot doesn't respond to commands | Verify bot has Discord permissions (Send Messages, Read Messages) |
| High memory usage | Reduce `CONTEXT_MESSAGE_LIMIT` or increase `LONG_TERM_RETENTION_DAYS` |
| Commands not appearing | Set `REGISTER_COMMANDS=true`, restart once, then set back to false |

## 🎮 Usage Guide

### 🧬 The Memory System
Mascord doesn't just "see" the last message. It manages context in three layers:
1. **Passive Observation**: The bot reads all messages (even without mentions) to maintain a live history.
2. **Conversation Context**: When you run `/chat`, it automatically pulls the last ~50 messages into the LLM's prompt.
3. **Working Memory**: For very long conversations, use `/settings context summarize`. This condenses the history into a "Working Memory" snippet that the bot always sees.
4. **Historical Search**: Use `/search` or tell the bot to "search for X" to trigger the RAG engine over months of historical logs.

### 🎵 Music Player Tips
- **Buttons**: The `/queue` command provides interactive buttons. You don't need to memorize commands once playback starts.
- **Cookies**: If you encounter `403 Forbidden` errors from YouTube, export your browser cookies to a `cookies.txt` and set the `YOUTUBE_COOKIES` path in your `.env`.

### 🤖 Multi-Step Tasks (Agent)
Use `/agent` for requests that require multiple actions. 
*Example: "Search for the last time we talked about the API design, summarize it, and then play some lofi music."*
## Future Capabilities (Roadmap)
- [ ] **Multimodal Search**: Index image attachments and embeds in RAG using CLIP/SigLIP models.
- [ ] **Vision Support**: Enable LLM to analyze images and screenshots shared in Discord.
- [ ] **Enhanced Audio**: Support for Spotify and local audio collections.
- [ ] **Web Search**: Integrated browsing tool for live information retrieval.

## 📋 Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/chat` | Chat with the bot using current context memory. |
| `/search` | Manually search through the RAG database. |
| `/reminder` | Set reminders directly (`when` + `message`) or manage via `action` (`list`, `cancel`, `help`). |
| `/agent` | Task the bot to perform a complex, multi-step action. |
| `/play` | Stream audio from a YouTube URL. |
| `/queue` | View the interactive, paginated music player. |
| `/settings context` | Manage context limits or trigger common memory refreshes. |
| `/admin shutdown` | Safely save state and exit (Owner Only). |
